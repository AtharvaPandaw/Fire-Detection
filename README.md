Image Classification using Deep Learning
Overview
This project implements an image classification model using deep learning techniques. It utilizes a convolutional neural network (CNN) to classify images into different categories. The model is trained on a dataset of labeled images and can predict the class of new images based on learned patterns.

Project Structure
AtharvaPandaw33_Final_ImageClassification.ipynb â€“ Jupyter Notebook containing the full implementation of the image classification model, including data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and testing.

Dataset (Not included) â€“ The dataset should be placed in an appropriate directory before running the notebook.

Requirements.txt (if applicable) â€“ Contains dependencies needed for running the project.

Features
âœ” Data Preprocessing (Resizing, Normalization, Augmentation)
âœ” Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for Image Classification
âœ” Training and Validation with Performance Metrics

Dataset
This project requires an image dataset with labeled categories.

You can use public datasets like CIFAR-10, ImageNet, or a custom dataset.

Usage
Load the dataset and preprocess the images.

Train the model using the provided architecture.

Evaluate performance on the test dataset.

Use the trained model to classify new images.

Results
The trained model achieves good accuracy on the test dataset.

Performance metrics such as precision, recall, and F1-score are used for evaluation.

Future Enhancements
ðŸ”¹ Implement transfer learning using pre-trained models like ResNet, VGG16, or EfficientNet.
ðŸ”¹ Optimize model performance using hyperparameter tuning.
ðŸ”¹ Deploy the trained model as a web application or API for real-world usage.
